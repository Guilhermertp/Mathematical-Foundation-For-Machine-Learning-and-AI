#Graphing Porbability Density Function in R

#Example : Plçotting the normal distribution of children's IQ scores - mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15
#what percentage of children have an IQ score greater than 115?

#define paramenters of our distribution
mean = 100
standev = 15

#define lower and upper bounds of region of interest
lower = 115
upper = Inf

#Generate sequence of numbers and make the normal distribution
x <- seq(-4, 4, lenght=100) * standev + mean
prob <- dnorm(x, mean, standev)

#Make plot and add probability distribution and axis labels
plot(x, prob, type="n", xlab = "IQ values", ylab = "P(x)", main = "Normal dsitribution of IQ Scores", axes = FALSE)
lines(x, prob)
axis(1, at=seq(40, 160, 20), pos = 0)
